# HackUTK Website

This website is built using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), a static site generator. That means it contains template files in `layouts/` and content files in `content/`, and these two things get combined to generate the website's HTML.

To develop the website locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hackutk/hackutk.github.io
$ cd hackutk.github.io
$ hugo server
```

Then check `localhost:1313` to see the website.
